detect.core.artifacts
---------------------

Artifact saving controls and the result object returned by detect_video().

Key design goals:
- All artifacts are optional (JSON, frames, annotated video).
- If nothing is being saved, no output directories should be created.
- When imported/used as a library, the in-memory JSON payload is always returned.
